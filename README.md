# Research Project Overview: Simple Benchmark Tests for ZKML

## Introduction

This research project aims to conduct benchmark tests on Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML) across various platforms. The goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of four specific ZKML frameworks: MINA zkML, ezkl, Orion, and RISC Zero. We will focus on four different machine learning models to assess their efficiency and effectiveness under ZKML constraints.

## Benchmark Platforms
MINA zkML: A blockchain platform designed to provide a lightweight, secure, and efficient environment for ZKML.
ezkl: Known for its user-friendly setup and efficient ZKML processing.
Orion: Offers a robust environment with a focus on secure and scalable ZKML solutions.
RISC Zero: Emphasizes high security and scalability in its ZKML implementations.

## Target Models

### 1 Month Milestone
